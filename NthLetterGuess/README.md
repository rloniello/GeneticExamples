# NthLetterGuess
## iOS Project
- [x] Update the UI after each Generation.
- [x] Character-based chromosome.
- [x] Variable length chromosome.
This project shows how to implement a character-based chromosome to find a solution matching the user's input.
Fitness is calculated by the Hamming Distance to a target string. 
It is quite common to encode chromosomes into characters that represent features of the organism. 

## General Information
In many genetic algorithms the chromsome is key-value encoded from characters that represent one aspect of the problem in which they are attempting to solve. 
For instance, an "n" may represent any number and a "p" may represent an addition operation.
If you've properly defined the problem and chromosme in which to use to solve it, the solution then becomes a search for the proper string that fulfills the problem. 

This application should be used as a demonstration, showing how a genome can be created on-the-fly rather than hard coded. 
It should soon become evident to the reader that a solution can start narrow, and expand to into a larger string and thus a larger problem domain.
